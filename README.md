# Car Gallery
## This is a very simple website I created for my Telerik School Academy course which uses only HTML anc CSS (mostly)

### 1. Content

The first part of the website is the `header` which contains the the top navigation menu with the different brands of cars, the car name and photo and basic information about it.

The second part of the website are the photos and quotes (of some of the cars).

### 2. Details

The website has animations and little details that make it look and feel premium.
